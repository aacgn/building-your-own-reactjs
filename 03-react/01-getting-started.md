#Building your own React.js

Ok, hopefully you have now a better understanding what a React.js-like library **should** do
and **how** it *could* do it. 
It's exciting that in the previous sections we already discussed the different ingredients 
needed for building a simplified clone of React.js. 
The major differentation form the previous section is that we will stay close to React.js' architecture. The goal is 
to use our previously collected knowledge in apply it in a more complex environment. 

Of course for brevity sake and time concerns some elements are skipped, like the `reconciler`, or massively simplified.
