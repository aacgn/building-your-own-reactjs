# Recursion

As it turns out recursion is an extremely important factor in building (and updating) the `DOM`. 
In hindsight this is actually to be expected because we're working with a tree of data. 
 
In our previous section we've used a minimal version of our `vElement` only consisting of a `tag` and `className` and `dom` 
property. The final definition of our `vElement` which we're going to use, is:

```
type VElement = {
  tag: string,
  props: {
    children: vNodeList || emtpy,
    etc.
  },
  className: string,
  style: string,
  dom: ?Node
}
```

Because we're building a tree of data, one **prop**erty is of extra importance. 
Can you guess which one? It's the **children** property :smile:

> We've defined our children property on our props object 
because this is the convention that React uses. You can access the 
children using this.props.children. 

The children property can be empty or a `vNodeList`. A `vNodeList` is simply an array of `vNodes`. 
Arrays are pretty good at keeping order and are easy to iterate on. 
And that's exactly what we're going to need when building a tree :evergreen_tree: 

Let's update the `createVElement function`.

```javascript
index.js
...

function createVElement(tag, config, children = null) {
  const { className } = config;

  return {
    tag: tag,
    props: {
      children: children,
    },
    className: className,
    dom: null,
  }
}

```

We want to redefine our application with a header and a paragraph. 

```javascript
index.js
...

const myApp = createVElement('div', { className:'my-class' }, [
  createVElement('h1', { className:'my-header' }),
  createVElement('p', { className: 'my-paragraph'})
]);

```

The HTML equivelant would be:

```html
<div class="my-class">
  <h1 class="my-header"></h1>
  <p class="my-paragraph"></p>
</div>
```
The important thing to notice is: we now have multiple nodes and that some of these nodes are nested. 
How to handle this? Well, the title probably already gave it away, **recurse** it!

While using recursion we can reuse our `mountVElement` function, because, 
well each child is an `vElement` that needs to be mounted. We just need to adapt our `mountVElement` function. 
We need to watch for the `children` property, and if it exists we need to **mount** its content(s).   

```javascript
function mountVElement(vElement, parentDOMnode) {
  const { className, tag, props } = vElement;
  
  //create a native DOM node
  const domNode = document.createElement(tag);
  
  //for later reference save the DOM node
  //on our vElement
  vElement.dom = domNode;

  if (props.children) {
    //Important: we pass the parentDOMnode 
    //again and again
     children.forEach((child) => 
      mountVElement(child, domNode)
    });
  }
  
  //add className to native node
  if (className !== undefined) {
    domNode.className = className;
  }

  //Append domNode to to our parentDOMNode
  parentDOMnode.appendChild(domNode);
}

```

Even with just three (3) nodes, this part can be difficult to understand. 
There is a lot of mutating and recursing going on here. Our (atleast mine) mind(s) 
aren't built for this. That's why computers are awesome üñ•üëè . 

But with just three nodes we can give it a try. In the table below the 
steps are (conceptually) laid out:

| Iteration | parentDOMNode | vElement | Resulting DOM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `body` | `div.my-class` | `body` |
| 2 | `.my-class` | `h1.my-header` | `body div.my-class > h1.my-header` |
| 3 | `.my-class` | `p.my-paragraph` | `body div.my-class > h1.my-header, p.my-paragraph` |


Hopefully with the above table you can reason about how the `DOM` is actually built from our `vElements`. 
If not try to place some `debugger` statements in places you see fit. 
Or just accept the fact that mutation and looping can be hard to understand and our working memory is limited :smile: 

**Warning** If you would use`console.log` statement to debug, you will find that the printed `domNode`(s) 
are already mutated before you can inspect them (what is an insight in itself). 



## Building a complex DOM üèØ
Now we have made great progression! We this little bit of code we can even create a complex DOM with 
lots of nested nodes. 

Let's give it a shot!

```javascript

const myApp = createVElement('div', { className: 'my-class' }, [
  createVElement('h1', { className:'my-header' }),
  createVElement('div', { className:'my-container' }, [
    createVElement('div', { className:'my-sub-container' }, [
      createVElement('div', { className:'my-sub-sub-container' }, [
        createVElement('div', { className:'my-sub-sub-sub-container' }, [
          createVElement('div', { className:'my-sub-sub-sub-sub-container' }, [
            createVElement('div', { className:'my-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-container' }, []),
            createVElement('h1', { className:'my-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-header' }, [])
          ])
        ])
      ])
    ]),
  ])
]);

```

No problemo for our code! We can build a deeply nested `DOM` without any problems. Computers are awesome
indeed, Take that stupid brain!

But what is the role of our `vDOM` in all of this? Curious? Me too! 
Let's head off to the next section
