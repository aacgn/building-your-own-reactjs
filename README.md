# Build our own React.js!

In this book/guide we build our own simplified version of React.js. We keep it simple but
extensive enough to learn a lot of cool things about React.js and React.js-like libraries! 
I try to keep the naming of the different elements closely to how React.js
names it's stuff so we can impress people at parties with our knowledge of private methods and shit.  

If you have found any screw-ups, errors and/or inconsistencies please be so kind to report them by opening
an issue or contact me at: [@swennemans](https://twitter.com/swennemanns)
I hope you can learn something from it!
